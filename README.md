# PlanUpp

# Inspiration:
Coordinating sports sessions with friends often led to endless group chats, unclear availability, and double bookings. PlanUpp was born to simplify the process — a centralized platform to discover, schedule, and manage sports events effortlessly.

# What it does:
PlanUpp is a full-stack web application that streamlines sports event bookings. Users can create and join games, check real-time slot availability, chat with participants, and manage schedules — all in one intuitive interface. It also features secure user authentication and dynamic dashboards for seamless coordination.

# How we built it:
The front-end was built with React.js, emphasizing a modern, responsive UI/UX. The back-end uses Node.js and Express to handle RESTful APIs, with PostgreSQL as the primary database, optimized using indexing and caching for fast query performance. The development process followed the complete Software Engineering Lifecycle, from gathering user requirements and drafting UML diagrams to maintaining detailed technical documentation. The platform is designed to scale, with clean architecture and deployment strategies aligned with industry best practices.
